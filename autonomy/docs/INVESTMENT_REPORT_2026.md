# GSTD Investment Report 2026

**Mission**: Democratize access to high-performance computing (HPC) by aggregating idle consumer hardware into a global, decentralized grid.

## 1. Value Proposition (The "AWS Killer" Feature)

*   **Price**: $0.02 / hour per Compute Unit (Standard).
*   **Comparison**: ~52% cheaper than Amazon EC2 t3.medium ($0.0416/hr).
*   **Data Transfer**: **FREE**. (AWS charges $0.09/GB for egress).
*   **No Lock-in**: Pay-as-you-go using GSTD tokens on TON blockchain.

## 2. Infrastructure Stats (Live)

*   **Network Power**: ~15.2 TFLOPS (Bootstrap Phase).
*   **Active Nodes**: 500+ (Projected Q3 2026).
*   **Active Countries**: 12+ (Geographic diversity for censorship resistance).
*   **Eco-Friendly**: 100% of compute is "Recycled" (using idle capacity of existing devices), earning the **Eco-Proof Label**.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Orchestration**: Go (Golang) + Docker.
*   **Blockchain**: TON (The Open Network) for high-speed micropayments.
*   **Consensus**: Proof-of-Work (PoW) validation for task correctness.
*   **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (End-to-End).

## 4. Financial Model

*   **Worker Revenue**: Workers earn ~85% of the task fee.
*   **Platform Fee**: 15% (used for buyback & burn of GSTD + dev fund).
*   **Liquidity**: GSTD is backed by XAUt (Tether Gold) in the on-chain Golden Reserve pool.

## 5. Roadmap

*   **Q1 2026**: Mainnet Launch (Completed).
*   **Q2 2026**: GPU Marketplace (H100/A100 Rentals).
*   **Q3 2026**: Enterprise API & SDK Release.
*   **Q4 2026**: 1 Million Active Jobs Milestone.
