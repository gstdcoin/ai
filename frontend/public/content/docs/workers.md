# Workers Documentation

## Overview
Workers are the computational power providers in the GSTD ecosystem. They contribute CPU/GPU resources to execute distributed tasks and earn GSTD tokens as compensation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
- Visit [app.gstdtoken.com](https://app.gstdtoken.com)
- Connect your TON wallet using TonConnect
- Ensure you have at least 1 GSTD token

### 2. Register Your Device
- Click "Register Device" in the dashboard
- Select your device type and resources
- Submit registration request

### 3. Start Earning
- Accept available tasks from the task queue
- Execute tasks on your device
- Receive GSTD token rewards

## Device Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 2 cores, 2.0 GHz
- **RAM**: 4 GB
- **Storage**: 10 GB free space
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (10 Mbps+)

### Recommended Requirements
