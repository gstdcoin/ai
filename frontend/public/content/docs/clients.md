# Clients Documentation

## Overview
Clients are users who request computational power from the GSTD network. They submit tasks, pay in GSTD tokens, and receive processed results.

## Getting Started

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
- Visit [app.gstdtoken.com](https://app.gstdtoken.com)
- Connect your TON wallet using TonConnect
- Ensure you have sufficient GSTD tokens

### 2. Submit a Task
- Navigate to the "Create Task" section
- Define your computational requirements
- Set your budget in GSTD tokens
- Submit the task to the network

### 3. Monitor Progress
- Track task execution in real-time
- View worker performance metrics
- Receive notifications when complete
- Download processed results

## Task Types

### Data Processing
- Large dataset analysis
- Machine learning inference
