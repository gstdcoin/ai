# GSTD vs Amazon EC2: Investment Comparison Report

**Executive Summary**: GSTD offers a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud providers, leveraging idle consumer hardware to provide compute power at **40-60% lower cost** while maintaining high availability through redundancy.

## 1. Cost Comparison (Per Compute Unit)

| Feature | Amazon EC2 (t3.medium) | GSTD (Standard Node) | Difference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Specs** | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM (Avg) | Equal |
| **Price / Hour** | **$0.0416** (On-Demand) | **~$0.02** (in GSTD) | **-52%** |
| **Data Transfer** | Expensive ($0.09/GB) | **Free** (Included) | **Infinite ROI** |
| **Storage** | EBS costs extra | Ephemeral included | Savings |
| **Commitment** | None (On-Demand) | None | Equal |

**Investor Takeaway**: GSTD undercuts the market leader by >50% by eliminating data center overhead (cooling, rent, security).

## 2. Operational Model Comparison

### Amazon AWS
*   **Centralized**: Single point of failure (Region outages).
*   **KYC/Corporate**: Requires credit cards, address verification, account approval.
*   **Hardware**: Proprietary data centers.
*   **Green Score**: Medium (Improving, but massive energy consumption).

### GSTD Network
*   **Decentralized**: Resilient. If one node fails, task reroutes instantly.
*   **Permissionless**: Connect with a TON wallet. No names, no cards.
*   **Hardware**: Global grid of existing consumer devices (Circular Economy).
*   **Green Score**: **High** (Utilizes electricity already spent/idle).

## 3. Market Opportunity

*   **Target Audience**: AI Researchers, Student Developers, crypto-native dApps, Scrapers/Crawlers.
*   **Market Gap**: High demand for cheap, short-term compute (Spot Instances) which is often unavailable or complex on AWS.
*   **Unique Selling Point**: **Geographic Diversity**. A user can run code specifically in "Almaty" or "Residential IP" which is impossible with standard cloud providers.

## 4. Growth Projection (TFLOPS)

*   **Current**: ~15.2 TFLOPS (Bootstrap phase)
*   **Q3 2026**: 500 TFLOPS (Projected 1,000 active nodes)
*   **Q4 2026**: 2,500 TFLOPS (GPU Integration)

## 5. Conclusion

GSTD is not trying to replace AWS for banking infrastructure. It is disrupting the **flexible, ephemeral compute market** (Docker containers, CI/CD jobs, AI inference).

**Verdict**: Strong Buy / Early Stage Infrastructure Play.
