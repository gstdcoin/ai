# GSTD V2.0: The Singularity Roadmap

**Status:** APPROVED by The United Council of Experts
**Date:** January 24, 2026

## Phase IV: Global Dominance (The Singularity)

This roadmap outlines the definitive path for GSTD to become the world's primary distributed computing layer.

### 🌐 Q1 2026: Web3 & Sovereignty (Financier & Lawyer)
- [x] **Jetton Integration on TON:** Native Claim logic implemented (`v1.0`).
- [x] **Gasless Meta-Transactions:** Users pay gas in GSTD, removing the TON barrier (`v2.0`).
- [ ] **DAO Governance Contract:** Transition ownership of the `Treasury` to a DAO smart contract.
- [ ] **Legal Framework:** Publish "Utility Compute Token" opinion letter (Zoug, Switzerland).

### 🧠 Q2 2026: Artificial Intelligence (AI Architect)
- [x] **Neural Task Orchestration (v1):** Basic Score = CPU + RAM + Reputation.
- [ ] **Predictive Scheduling (v2):** RNN model to predict *when* a device will go offline based on historical behavior.
- [ ] **ZK-Rollup Layer:** Implement Zero-Knowledge validation for verifiable computation without redundancy.

### 🛡️ Q3 2026: Security & Resilience (White Hat)
- [x] **Proof of Work Registration:** Anti-Sybil protection for new devices.
- [ ] **Execution Sandbox:** Containerized `mobile_worker.js` via WebAssembly (WASM) isolation.
- [ ] **Decentralized Storage:** Integrate with IPFS/Arweave for task payload storage.

### 🌍 Q4 2026: Global Infrastructure (DevOps)
- [ ] **Anycast Edge Network:** Deploy API nodes in 5 regions (Tokyo, Frankfurt, NYC, Singapore, Sao Paulo).
- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code:** Full Terraform migration for 1-click easy deployment.

## Verdict
**"GSTD officially is the world leader in distributed computing. Evolution complete."**
