# GSTD Platform - User Guide

## How to Earn with GSTD

GSTD (Global System for Trusted Distributed Computing) allows you to monetize your device's computing power by performing AI inference and data processing tasks.

### 1. Getting Started

1.  **Connect Wallet**: Open [app.gstdtoken.com](https://app.gstdtoken.com) and connect your TON wallet (Tonkeeper, etc.).
2.  **Register Device**: Go to "Devices" tab and click "Register This Device".
3.  **Keep Tab Open**: Keep the browser tab open to receive and process tasks. The system uses your browser's capabilities (WebAssembly/WebGPU) to run tasks.

### 2. Earning Rewards

*   **Task Assignment**: Tasks are assigned based on your device's Trust Score and capabilities.
*   **Processing**: When a task is assigned, your device processes it automatically.
*   **Verification**: Results are verified by other nodes.
*   **Payout**: Once verified, rewards (GSTD) are sent directly to your wallet via the smart contract.

### 3. Trust Score

Your Trust Score determines your priority for high-value tasks.
*   **Accuracy**: Provide correct results.
*   **Latency**: Process tasks quickly.
*   **Stability**: Keep your node online and reliable.

**Note**: Bad actors or unstable nodes will see their Trust Score decrease, reducing earnings.

### 4. Referral Program

Invite others to join the network and earn 5% of the platform fees generated by their tasks.
1.  Go to **Stats** or **Profile**.
2.  Copy your Referral Code.
3.  Share it with friends.
4.  They must enter your code during their first login/registration.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Status "Offline"**: Ensure the tab is active and you have a stable internet connection.
*   **No Tasks**: Tasks depend on network demand. High-trust nodes get priority.
*   **Payment Delayed**: Payments are batched or queued on the blockchain. Check "Payouts" tab for status.
