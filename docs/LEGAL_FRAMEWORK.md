# GSTD Legal Framework: Utility Compute Token

**Jurisdiction:** Switzerland / Global
**Classification:** Utility Token (Not a Security)

## 1. Terms of Service (Compute Provider)
By running the GSTD Worker Node, you agree that:
1. You are providing **excess computational power** to the network.
2. GSTD tokens received are **compensation for service**, not investment dividends.
3. You are responsible for local electricity costs and internet usage.

## 2. Privacy Policy (GDPR / MiCA Compliance)
1. **Data Minimization:** We only collect Wallet Address (Public Key) and Device Metrics (CPU/RAM).
2. **No PII:** We do NOT collect names, emails, or phone numbers.
3. **Right to Erasure:** Disconnecting your wallet permanently delinks your device history.

## 3. Decentralized Nature
GSTD is a protocol, not a company. The "Treasury" is algorithmically managed to support network growth.
