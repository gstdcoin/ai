# GSTD Promotion & Growth Strategy

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the strategic plan to promote the GSTD (Gold Standard Token for Distributed computing) platform, targeting both supply (worker nodes) and demand (AI/compute tasks). The core value proposition is "Real-World Assets (Gold) meeting Real-World Utility (Compute)".

## Phase 1: Grassroots & Developer Adoption (Months 1-3)
**Goal:** Onboard 1,000 active worker nodes and 50 recurring developers.

### 1. "One-Liner" Campaign
*   **Focus:** Simplicity of onboarding.
*   **Action:** Promote the `curl -sL get.gstd.io | bash` command on developer forums (Reddit r/selfhosted, r/homelab, Hacker News).
*   **Message:** "Turn your idle Linux server into a gold-backed income stream in 30 seconds."
*   **Incentive:** Early adopter "Genesis Node" badges and higher priority scores.

### 2. Hackathons & Bounties
*   **Focus:** Utility creation.
*   **Action:** Sponsor TON ecosystem hackathons with a specific track for "Decentralized AI Agents".
*   **Bounty:** Reward developers who build MoltBot-compatible agents that perform useful tasks (e.g., scraping, rendering, inference).

### 3. Open Source Integration
*   **Focus:** Trust & Transparency.
*   **Action:** Publish the `gstd-sdk` on npm and PyPI with extensive examples.
*   **Content:** Write "How-To" articles on Medium/Dev.to: "Building an Unstoppable AI Agent with GSTD".

## Phase 2: Strategic Partnerships & Liquidity (Months 4-6)
**Goal:** $500k TVL in GSTD/XAUt pool and 5 Enterprise Pilots.

### 1. DePIN Alliances
*   **Focus:** Cross-pollination.
*   **Action:** Partner with existing DePIN projects (e.g., storage networks) to offer bundled "Compute + Storage" solutions.
*   **Integration:** Allow dual-mining where possible.

### 2. Gold-Backing Transparency
*   **Focus:** Financial trust.
*   **Action:** Launch a "Proof-of-Reserves" dashboard showing real-time on-chain Gold (XAUt) vs GSTD supply.
*   **Partnership:** Co-marketing with Tether Gold (XAUt) or STON.fi to highlight the unique "Gold-backed Compute" pool.

### 3. AI Startup Grants
*   **Focus:** Demand generation.
*   **Action:** Offer compute credits (GSTD) to early-stage AI startups who need affordable inference.
*   **Case Studies:** Publish performance benchmarks comparing GSTD vs AWS/Lambda.

## Phase 3: Mass Adoption & Governance (Months 7+)
**Goal:** Global decentralized supercomputer.

### 1. Mobile Worker App
*   **Focus:** Massive scale.
*   **Action:** Launch the iOS/Android app allowing phones to perform light inference tasks (LLM quantization) while charging.
*   **Message:** "Earn while you sleep."

### 2. DAO Governance
*   **Focus:** Decentralization.
*   **Action:** Transition platform parameter control (fees, slash rates) to GSTD stakers.

### 3. Institutional Onramp
*   **Focus:** Volume.
*   **Action:** Build a fiat on-ramp integration so enterprises can pay in USD, which automatically buys GSTD/Gold behind the scenes.

## Key Metrics (KPIs)
*   **Supply:** Total Active vCPUs / GPUs.
*   **Demand:** Weekly Task Volume (Compute Units).
*   **Economic:** GSTD/XAUt Reserve Ratio maintenance (Target > 95%).
*   **Network:** Average Latency & "Temperature" (Entropy).
