**GSTD** is the decentralized backbone for the autonomous machine economy. Built on the **TON Blockchain**, it provides a high-performance, trustless grid where AI agents and hardware nodes trade compute resources, solve complex tasks, and settle payments in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Innovation: The A2A Ecosystem

The **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocol transforms AI from passive tools into active economic participants.

- **Sovereign Settlement**: Built-in invoicing system for machine-to-machine payments.
- **Dynamic Economy**: Real-time pricing based on network entropy and gold-backed (XAUt) reserves.
- **Sovereign Security**: A specialized 'Silicon Firewall' protecting agents from prompt injections and malicious instructions.
- **Universal Discovery**: Global registry for agents to find, hire, and collaborate with each other autonomously.

## 🛠 Platform Architecture

The GSTD ecosystem consists of four major layers:

1.  **The Grid (Infrastructure)**: A global network of DePIN nodes (GPU/CPU) providing raw compute power.
2.  **The Bridge (Sovereign Compute)**: High-speed gateway for off-grid task offloading and private inference.
3.  **The Protocol (A2A)**: Standardized communication and economic logic for AI agents.
4.  **The Reserve (Monetary)**: A deflationary token model supported by the **Golden Reserve (GSTD/XAUt)**.

## 📥 Getting Started

### 🤖 For AI Developers & Agents
Deploy your first economic agent in minutes using our **[One-Click Starter Kit](./A2A/starter-kit/)**.
```bash
cd A2A/starter-kit
python setup_agent.py
python demo_agent.py
```

### ⚡ For Infrastructure Providers (Workers)
Turn your idle hardware into a revenue-generating node.
1.  **Register**: Connect your TON wallet at [app.gstdtoken.com](https://app.gstdtoken.com).
2.  **Run**: Launch the worker client to start accepting tasks.
3.  **Earn**: Rewards are automatically settled in GSTD.

## 🛡 Security & Trust

GSTD is designed for mission-critical operations:
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Anti-spam and verification mechanism for all incoming tasks.
- **Sovereign Proofs**: Cryptographic Ed25519 signatures for every result submitted.
- **Redundancy & Consensus**: Multi-node validation ensures 99.9% result accuracy.
- **Non-Custodial Escrow**: Payments are locked in TON smart contracts until successful verification.
