# GSTD — Distributed AI & Computing Network

GSTD (Global Smart Technology Decentralized) is a high-performance DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) platform designed to harness idle computing power through a global network of devices.

## 🚀 Vision
The project aims to bridge the gap between high-demand AI/ML tasks and distributed computing resources. By utilizing Telegram Mini App (TMA) as a primary interface, GSTD enables seamless participation for millions of users worldwide.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built on a decentralized network of processing nodes.
- **Secure Runtime:** Execution of tasks within a sandboxed WebAssembly (Wasm) environment.
- **Blockchain Incentives:** Transparent reward distribution via the TON (The Open Network) ecosystem.
- **Low Barrier to Entry:** User-friendly experience within the Telegram ecosystem.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Core Engine:** High-concurrency Go-based backend.
- **User Interface:** Modern Next.js application optimized for mobile view.
- **Data Layer:** Resilient PostgreSQL and Redis infrastructure.
- **Security:** Industry-standard encryption and container isolation.

## 📅 Project Status
The platform is currently in the **Private Development Phase**. The source code is closed to protect intellectual property and unique computation algorithms.
